# API Scheduler

## Objective
Schedule API calls to `ifconfig.co` at specified timestamps with second-level precision. Supports concurrent API calls for duplicate timestamps.

## Features
1. Accepts timestamps via command-line arguments.
2. Calls the API `https://ifconfig.co` to fetch the IP address.
3. Handles multiple calls at the same second using threads.
4. Logs output and errors to `api_scheduler.log`.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Internet connection.

### Running the Script
```bash
python api_scheduler.py --timestamps "09:15:25,11:58:23,13:45:09,13:45:09"
